## Overview
The Bank Loan Report project aims to develop a robust reporting system that provides comprehensive insights into our bank's lending activities and loan portfolio performance. Through a series of dashboards and detailed reports, the project will empower stakeholders to make informed decisions, monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), and optimize lending strategies.


## Objectives

 1. Monitor and Assess Lending Activities: Establish a monitoring system to track critical metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. This monitoring will enable ongoing assessment of our lending operations' health and performance.

 2. Distinguish Good vs. Bad Loans: Implement KPIs to differentiate between 'Good Loans' (e.g., fully paid and current loans) and 'Bad Loans' (e.g., charged off loans). This distinction will facilitate evaluating loan portfolio quality and identifying risk factors affecting loan performance.

 3. Visualize Data Trends: Utilize various chart types including line charts for monthly trends, filled maps for regional analysis, donut charts for loan term breakdowns, bar charts for employment length and loan purpose analyses, and tree maps for home ownership insights. These visualizations will provide intuitive representations of loan metrics to uncover trends and patterns.

 4. Detailed Insights through Dashboards: Develop three distinct dashboards:
- Summary Dashboard: Focuses on high-level KPIs and overall portfolio health metrics.
- Overview Dashboard: Visualizes key metrics and trends using a variety of charts to facilitate deeper analysis and strategic       decision-making.
- Details Dashboard: Provides a consolidated view of comprehensive loan data, borrower profiles, and detailed performance metrics   for in-depth exploration and user-friendly access.

 5. Facilitate Data-Driven Decisions: Enable stakeholders to access timely and relevant loan data through user-friendly dashboards and reports. This will support data-driven decision-making processes across various levels of the organization.
